###IMPORTANT!!!
This application requires you have your own Google Maps API key. You can get it for Free(But note: you have to set your limits so you dont pay api charges)
# Google Maps API Setup

This app requires a Google Maps API key to function properly. Follow these steps to set it up:

## Getting Your Google Maps API Key

1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create a new project or select an existing one
3. Enable the following APIs:
   - Maps SDK for Android
   - Maps SDK for iOS
   - Places API (if using places features)
4. Go to **Credentials** ‚Üí **Create Credentials** ‚Üí **API Key**
5. Copy your API key (it will look like: `AIzaSyBxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`)


## API Key Restrictions (Recommended)!!!!!!

For security, restrict your API key in the Google Cloud Console:

1. Go to your API key in **Credentials**
2. Click **Edit** 
3. Under **Application restrictions**:
   - For Android: Add your app's package name and SHA-1 fingerprint
   - For iOS: Add your app's bundle identifier
4. Under **API restrictions**: Select only the APIs you need

## Cost Information & Protection

Google Maps has a free tier, but it's important to protect yourself from unexpected charges:

### Free Tier Details
Google provides free monthly credits, but amounts and pricing can change. Always check the current details at [Google Maps Pricing](https://cloud.google.com/maps-platform/pricing) before setting up your API key.

### Protecting Yourself from Charges
1. **Enable billing alerts** (see Quotas section above)
2. **Set conservative daily quotas** to limit usage (start low, increase if needed)
3. **Monitor usage** in Google Cloud Console under **APIs & Services** ‚Üí **Enabled APIs**
4. **Consider disabling APIs** you're not using

**Important**: Start with low quotas and low budget alerts. You can always increase them later, but you can't undo unexpected charges.
## For Local Development

1. Clone this repository
2. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project
3. Add your API key to the `.env` file:
   ```
   GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=AIzaSyBxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
   ```
4. Make sure `.env` is in your `.gitignore` (it already should be)
5. Run `npm install` and start the app with `expo start` or `npm start`

## Troubleshooting

- **Maps not loading**: Double-check your API key is correct and the required APIs are enabled
- **"This page can't load Google Maps correctly"**: Your API key may be restricted or invalid
- **Quota exceeded**: Check your usage in Google Cloud Console and ensure billing is enabled for higher quotas
