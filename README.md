2. Create a new project or select an existing one
3. Enable the following APIs:
   - Maps SDK for Android
   - Maps SDK for iOS
   - Places API (if using places features)
4. Go to **Credentials** ‚Üí **Create Credentials** ‚Üí **API Key**
5. Copy your API key (it will look like: `AIzaSyBxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`)

 ## API Key Restrictions (Recommended)!!!!!!

For security, restrict your API key in the Google Cloud Console:

2. Click **Edit** 
3. Under **Application restrictions**:

## **üö® PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE READ THIS IMPORTANT INFORMATION. YES ITS THAT IMPORTANT. üö®**

Google Maps has a free tier, but it's important to protect yourself from unexpected charges:

### Free Tier Details
Google provides free monthly credits, but amounts and pricing can change. Always check the current details at [Google Maps Pricing](https://cloud.google.com/maps-platform/pricing) before setting up your API key.

### Protecting Yourself from Charges
1. **Enable billing alerts** (see Quotas section above)
2. **Set conservative daily quotas** to limit usage (start low, increase if needed)

4. **Consider disabling APIs** you're not using
