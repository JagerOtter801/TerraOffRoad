# Terra Off-Road 🏔️

🗺️ ## Plan Smarter, Adventure Better
Never Miss a Moment on the Trail
TerraOffRoad helps you plan and navigate your off-road adventures with confidence. Before you hit the trail, mark essential waypoints like gas stations, hospitals, grocery stores, and campsites. Use detailed topographical maps to scout elevation changes at your campsite or trailhead—because knowing the terrain makes all the difference.
Stay Prepared with Location-Based Weather
Tap any waypoint to see current conditions and a 3-day forecast for that exact location. Planning a weekend camp? Check the weather ahead of time so you know whether to pack rain gear or sunscreen. No more getting caught off guard by mountain weather.
Track Your Progress in Real-Time
Out on the trail, save waypoints for places you want to remember: stunning viewpoints, hidden landmarks, geocaching spots, or that perfect camping spot you stumbled upon. Watch your live location on the map as you get closer to your saved waypoints—you'll always know how far you are from that overlook or trailhead you're searching for.

## 🎒Pack Smart with Gear Management
Stop forgetting critical gear. Use the built-in gear list to track everything you need across organized categories: Vehicle Items, Shelter, Sleeping System, Emergency/Medical, Clothing, Cooking, Food, Lighting/Signaling, Electronics, and Misc. Check off items as you pack, and never wonder if you forgot your first aid kit or camp stove again.
Whether you're planning your next adventure or creating memories on the go, TerraOffRoad keeps you organized, prepared, and connected to the places that matter most.
